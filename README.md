# Carbon-Tracker
A project that helps individuals and organizations to track and reduce their carbon emissions to save the environment.
## What it does
This project allows us to know more about the impacts of carbon emissions and take a pledge on this new year to save the planet. This is done using Twilio's SendGrid API and Hedera Blockchain. Also, we provide a carbon calendar using which we can add our daily carbon emissions and track them. This carbon footprint is also added to Hedera making it immutable and helping to keep us accountable to our carbon emission!

## How we built it
Our website frontend is built using React. 
1. The Pledge is implemented using SendGrid API from Twilio and Hedera Smart Contract
2. We are logging the carbon footprint on the Hedera Blockchain for immutability
3. Graph.JS has been used to create a Graph of Carbon Footprint logged by the user in the Carbon Calendar.
4. We are using Express for the backend server.
